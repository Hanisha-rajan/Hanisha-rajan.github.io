     <p> Well hello there! <br> All i do is, play the Piano, pen down songs and poems, write down journals,
         research a hell lot about travel places, and of course, CODE!! The languages i am familiar with include
         HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT in web dev.. In core programming, all i know is C and C++ and a little of Python..
         I am indeed very much interested in the Spider club.. I hope to learn a lot more in the process of
         induction..<br>
         Thanks for viewing my profile! :)
